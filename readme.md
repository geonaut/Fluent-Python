## Chapter One

The book starts with a chapter on the Python data object, highlighting the advantages of using special methods (aka dunder methods), as they give access to core language features â€” like iteration and slicing from the standard library. A small class is created, that implements some special methods. From there, slice and choice are used, without having programmed them. It is clear from the example that one of the biggest advantages of using Python's magic methods is that they provide a simple way to make objects behave like built-in types. That means you can avoid ugly, counter-intuitive, and nonstandard ways of performing basic operators. For example, the __add__ dunder method is implmented to enable the adding of two dictionaries, where the + operand is not supported by the 'dict' type.

## Chapter Two

Chapter 2 dives into the Python sequence types, based on the C primitives. Firstly, the list type is discussed, including list comprehension and generator expressions, for creating lists and Cartesian products. These are compared with for loops, and map and filter functions. Secondly tuples are covered, both as records with no names, and immutable lists. This includes tuple unpacking, named tuples and the associated special attibutes, such as `__make` and `__asdict`. Thirdly, there is the a good section on slicing, nested lists, augmented assignment and sorting. There are a few exercises that cover list searching using `bisect` and large lists in arrays. Fourthly, there is a section on memory views, which allow direct manuipulation of data objects through byte poking. The last section introduces NumPy as a means of handling 2D arrays, and queues as a means of handling fixed length sequences.
